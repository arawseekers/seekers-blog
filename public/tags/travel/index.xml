      <title>That Week We Stayed at Bohol</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-day-22-nov&#34;&gt;First Day, 22 Nov&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-short-intro-to-a-long-travel-to-airport&#34;&gt;A short intro to a long travel to airport&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day started with the perennial traffic. If you&amp;rsquo;re from Metro Manila, of course, a day of commute starts there. It&amp;rsquo;s not that we didn&amp;rsquo;t almost make it on time to the airport, it&amp;rsquo;s just that we weren&amp;rsquo;t expecting a bad traffic jam on a non-rush hour, but hey, why are we even surprised?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did make it, though, on time - enough time, even, to have a quick lunch comprising unpalatable highway robbery airport food. The traffic situation that plagues the road of Metro Manila has converted the disciplined to disenfranchised in less time - much less time - it takes you to get from Ayala Blvd to&amp;hellip; well, Paseo de Roxas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;arrival-at-bohol&#34;&gt;Arrival at Bohol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we landed to Panglao Airport, we hopped on an airport service vehicle. Prices are steep, as expected from any airport services, so manage your expectations accordingly. It was about a 40-minute uneventful ride towards our lodging in Tagbilaran, save for the occasional comments of the passengers (the three of us, Isya, Merci [her mother], and Ohio &lt;em&gt;duh&lt;/em&gt; on the many an old wooden houses. This was just a small sample of Boholano architecture, and we all like it, simple and old that they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our night stroll let us expose ourselves to the native streets of Tagbilaran, which at some point was filled a plume of smoke from a burning garbage heap inside some gated compound. As &amp;lsquo;Nay Merci noted, &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s no different than Dumaguete [where I&amp;rsquo;m from].&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The random zigzagging of our walk landed us on an improptu concert-watching in no less than the San Jose Parish. &amp;ldquo;Adventus&amp;rdquo; it was called, performed by Koro Seraphim, the National Qualifier to the National Music Competitions for Young Artists Foundation (NAMCYA) 2019 Alab ng Musika Competitions, Senior Choir Category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Inside the Parish&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;second-day-23-nov&#34;&gt;Second Day, 23 Nov&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed the basic functions of tourists in our own country, to explore Bohol&amp;rsquo;s country side. The hotel we were in had offered a travel package the day before, and after considering that the price seemed reasonable, we now have our own driver and sedan to do this touristy trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;our-first-stop-was-the-baclayon-church&#34;&gt;Our first stop was the Baclayon Church.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing out of the ordinary, really, except that they have their own museum , whose memorabilia, as in all other museums, must not be touched. One of us (not Isya), uncultured that this person in is when it comes to behaving properly, didn&amp;rsquo;t know this fact until he already touched one old wooden artifact &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the sign &amp;ldquo;Do not touch anything&amp;rdquo; appeared, replete with a short explainer why (something about the oil in our hands that would later appear and damage the object).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;First Stop&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

         alt=&#34;A young couple in front of Baclayon Church&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-butterfly-garden&#34;&gt;The Butterfly Garden&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;disappointed us, in that it&amp;rsquo;s a claustrophobic experience with the butterflies. At the entrance, visitors are asked to pick the Butterfly Garden and/or Python Area. Only the former had interested us. They claim that some of the butterflies there are exotic species. If so, we asked ourselves, why are they still keeping them for public display?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/bohol17.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;young couple with a banner that says &amp;#39;Welcome to Butterfly Garden&amp;#39; behind them&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Look at how &amp;lsquo;disappointed&amp;rsquo; we are&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lunch-at-loboc-river&#34;&gt;Lunch at Loboc River&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More accurately, it&amp;rsquo;s an all-you-can eat buffet on a boat as it cruises to and from the river, while musicians you share the ride with serenade everyone. Be prepared, though: the music is loud. People seem to equate fun with high decibels. They no longer like peace and quiet that Nature brings. It&amp;rsquo;s here that we also note that every component of this touristy affair has been designed efficiently to serve the maximum number of people at the shortest amount of time. Productivity underscores profitability, and thus, in chasing efficiency, tourism (at least in this part of the country) has become mechanical, heartless dare we say. Wait, pardon the digression; such was the effect of food coma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bilar-loboc-forest&#34;&gt;Bilar-Loboc &amp;ldquo;Forest&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of heartlessness, birds may have developed through millenia of evolution how to spot a not-landing site. That&amp;rsquo;s why in the famed man-made forest, mostly mahogany (a non-native tree), no fowl flock nor frequent. Also, isn&amp;rsquo;t the term &amp;ldquo;man-made forest&amp;rdquo; a bit oxymoronic, if not outright arrogant? All that rant, and still we took pictures just to, uh, prove our point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/bohol03.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;a young couple in the middle of the road that passes through a forest&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/bohol13.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;a young woman in a forest&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The end of suffering?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tarsier-conservation-area&#34;&gt;Tarsier Conservation Area&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also saw Tarsiers, small primates that have got to be nocturnal, or else ultraviolet rays would blind their big eyes. Each one that we saw either slept or kept still under the shades in which they were carefully placed for public viewing. For some who are hoping to see one &amp;ldquo;in the wild&amp;rdquo;, this experience would baffle you, as it did us. The walk inside the conservatory has been limited to a brief mingling with in-house guides as they pointed to the tiny nappers; and it&amp;rsquo;s done on purpose, for better and for worse. To some extent, we understand that tarsiers ultimately do not exist for the pleasure of human entertainment. We do hope that in the future, through the conservatory&amp;rsquo;s efforts, the primates&amp;rsquo; population no longer is endangered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/bohol04.jpeg&#34;

            &lt;p&gt;Find the Tarsier&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;interstitial&#34;&gt;Interstitial&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought a &lt;em&gt;walis-tambo&lt;/em&gt; near the Sipatan River in the Municipality of Sevilla. Its handle is made of bamboo, while the actual broom is made of coconut husks, although we sheepishly thought that the fiber closely resembles that of frizzy human hair. We skipped the Hanging Bridges altogether. No, we&amp;rsquo;re not specifically contemptuous against altitudes but to other tourists who were more than willing to take up the space and time of such narrow bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/bohol24.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;the walis-tambo&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/bohol25.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;the walis-tambo&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the full review of the aforementioned walis (for content, of course):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design: 3/5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Durability: 4/5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functionality: 2/5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UX: 2/5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall score: 2.75 out of 5. If you ever see this on your next Bohol trip, we don&amp;rsquo;t recommend you to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;now-the-chocolate-hills&#34;&gt;Now, the Chocolate Hills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are a sight to behold, as cliche as that is. More than a thousand of them - the hills, not tourists - compete for attention, and rightfully so. They each have their own trait: stout, lonely, distant, huge, etc. We only got up on one big hill, developed for the specific purpose of it being the viewing deck on which to view all the other hills surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/bohol10.jpeg&#34;

&lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/bohol12.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;a young woman smiling, Chocolate Hills is her background&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/bohol07.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;a young man smiling, Chocolate Hills is his background&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ohio&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuna-republic&#34;&gt;Tuna Republic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isya has so many memories of this chain of restaurant. This was where they had frequently eaten back on her field days at Agusan del Sur. We had a feast by ordering kinilaw na tuna, sashimi tuna, tinola tuna, grilled tuna belly, rice, and camote. With all the tuna we had, we were worried with the level mercury we have might consumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;third-day-24-nov&#34;&gt;Third Day, 24 Nov&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free day to do whatever. This thing happens when people travel without a plan. It&amp;rsquo;s not bad per se. In fact, we are freed from the rigidity that plans make us comply, and we liked that. We had our breakfast near seaport. Our late lunch at Bee Farm Cafe in Island City Mall was the highlight of the day. In a simple day, food has to be the highlight in an otherwise relaxed pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fourth-day-25-nov&#34;&gt;Fourth Day, 25 Nov&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an island surrounded by seas, potable water in Bohol is hard to come by. Every drink must be bought or paid for. If it&amp;rsquo;s free, doubt yourself first before having the guts (literally) to drink it. Each cup of water must be sought after amid the choking thirst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swimming in the beach helped. When we transferred from Tagbilaran to Panglao that afternoon, it&amp;rsquo;s the only thing to look forward to: the almost-white sand shoreline littered with foreign bodies and boats with the setting sun as backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/bohol08.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;a small cliff side by the beach&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sunset at the Alona Beach&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the night, a different life emerged from slumber. Commercialization as an economic tool for tourism had changed this quiet beach into something noisy, smelly, and shiny, as if an introvert remodeling their habits to conform with peer pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifth-day-26-nov&#34;&gt;Fifth Day, 26 Nov&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohio flew back to Manila. &amp;ldquo;With what I saw, I&amp;rsquo;m not fond of Bohol&amp;rdquo; would be the personal feedback to give to those asking for anecdotes, but these experiences take time to process. (If it&amp;rsquo;s sounding too BS now, it&amp;rsquo;s probably because of the unpleasant experience of having to deal with airport security over a foldable bread knife. Not cool!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry to hear about Ohio&amp;rsquo;s experience with the new Panglao Airport having to confiscate his stainless foldable bread knife without even bothering to confiscate his wooden chopsticks (both, by the way, can be deadly weapons) which were a part of the mess kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, Isya and Merci, stayed behind for one more night to supposedly have more beach time. Strapped for cash, they were unable to watch the dolphins and do island hopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we decided to have lunch on the famous Bohol Bee Farm restaurant which seems to be a resort also. It was Isya&amp;rsquo;s first time to visit the place but Merci had been there numerous times, and she was shocked with all the development and expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isya did not find the expensive things there impressive at all. Recall the meal we (Isya and Ohio) had at the Bohol Bee Farm cafe in Island City Mall - it was cheaper. One positive thing about the lunch is enjoying the pineapple and basil juice. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those marriages of ingredients that make a pricey drink worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with all the restaurants and bars in Alona beach, it seems to be missing Japanese restaurants. We, Isya and Merci, combed the the stretch of the beach looking for one because Merci was craving for some Japanese dishes, and we found none. We settled with Lost Horizon restaurant, a beachfront dining with a live band playing songs of the oldies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sixth-day-27-nov&#34;&gt;Sixth Day, 27 Nov&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last day of our trip, we looked back (almost literally) on why we appreciate the second inn that we booked, called &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Walkerz Travellers Inn&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. Its distance from the Alona Beach not only provided serenity during our stay, it also required exercise to get to the main road, although the 7-minute walk is never that pleasant so long as the ways are still muddy, rocky, and unpaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made sure to check the Panglao Public Market in for local weaved baskets. We didn&amp;rsquo;t bring home any, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next stop: St. Augustine Church which was about 400 meters away from the market. Beside the church is a Catholic school, and not far from it is the barangay hall. Isya wasn&amp;rsquo;t keen on stepping inside the church while the floor was being mopped. After Merci took pictures of the inside, they decided to look at the park nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way out, Merci saw two men holding sticks with large nets which she recognized as contraption for catching stray dogs. Merci, always inquisitive, asked them what they were doing. They said they were from the provincial veterinary office, and were out to catch dogs. After the exchange, we learned that the dogs they caught would be brought back to the barangay hall, to be confined in their backyard. If, after three days, no one claimed them they would be euthanized. However, euthanasia is simply our place-holder here, as we haven&amp;rsquo;t really verified how they put down the dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They allowed us see the dogs they caught. What we saw was heartbreaking - rows of cages were lined up at the back of the barangay hall by the mangroves without roofing. They were exposed to elements. The first cage housed a very sick dog who was having a hard time sitting and laying down because of an inflamed wound at the rear part of its body. The dog wailed in pain, and hearing it only worsened whatever sickness we&amp;rsquo;re already feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried to find out more by asking a man there, but he seemed to be just passing by. Merci couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but break down when we were finally out in the open area. She wondered how the church, just a few steps away, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do anything about the plight of the stray dogs being impounded. There was no compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the street dogs became stray as a result human irresponsibility. There are humane ways to handle this issue of high numbers stray dogs. One of the most effective so far is Trap-Neuter-Vaccine-Release (TNVR) program which local government units can implement. The concerned community can also participate through sponsorships and volunteerism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a defeated feeling after this encounter, a kind of helplessness of not being able to do anything immediately. We walked towards the public market to wait for the bus shuttle. By this time, we needed to go back at the inn to prepare for our flight that afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parting-thoughts-by-isya&#34;&gt;Parting thoughts, by Isya&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bohol trip was a break from the pressures of city life. It&amp;rsquo;s also a chance to be with the people I love, and to spend time with them. But the Bohol I had longed for, the one my mother, Merci, had talked about years ago, was nowhere near the descriptions of peace and quiet in those stories. It could be that I have just high expectations of it not being another touristy crowded place. &lt;code&gt;-o)-&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Traveling for Work</title>
      <link>/travel-for-work/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/travel-for-work/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I was (un)lucky enough to be reassigned to the account that I thought I&amp;rsquo;d never be going back to.
Only this time around, the assignment&amp;rsquo;s scope is nationwide, as in I got to go to places in different parts of the country where there a project site exists.
Meaning, my employer would reimburse my travel expenses as long as they&amp;rsquo;re official business trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good time as any, for me at least, to recall these trips, knowing that travel is something I shall not be doing any time soon, until &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/04/07/duterte-extends-lockdown-to-april-30/&#34;&gt;30 Apr, according to someone&lt;/a&gt;.
And to be tethered to the house we choose, to help to flatten the curve, except for the few times that we have to run to the nearest wet market for food supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let me put here my travel notes, plus some photos &amp;ndash; ranging from late January to late February &amp;ndash; without mentioning anything work-related, because damn it, I &lt;em&gt;dislike&lt;/em&gt; working that much!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;calasiao-pangasinan&#34;&gt;Calasiao, Pangasinan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuck in BD&amp;rsquo;s orange Vios (which by the way, is everywhere these days, ugly as it is) with the U-Team for almost four hours now since we left Quezon City. Since I heard the term, I&amp;rsquo;ve been promoting &lt;em&gt;radical transparency&lt;/em&gt; where applicable, but the people of U-Team take it to the next level with their misogyny and sexism! And I was supposed to listen through it without complaining. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised, since a DOM leads them with his Boomer machismo. I remained silent throughout AA&amp;rsquo;s (the DOM) yapping. Back in the passenger seat, I was sandwiched between two men&amp;hellip; and I truly hope that doesn&amp;rsquo;t come off as an innuendo. Nothing particularly interesting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;san-fernando-la-union&#34;&gt;San Fernando, La Union&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/tfw21.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;inside looking out the beach&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The view of the beach from inside the Inn&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were booked in an inn called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.agoda.com/the-little-surfmaid-resort/hotel/la-union-ph.html&#34;&gt;Little Surf Maid&lt;/a&gt;. This is my first beach of the year, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have thought it would be because of some stupid work. In the many establishments that proliferate the beach side, the people of U-Team, headed by AA (who else), chose the most suffocating, un-ventilated, grimy nipa hut to drink &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; bottle of beer. His taste couldn&amp;rsquo;t be any less succinct. My colleague, AC, agrees that there are a lot of better food out there &amp;ndash; and I know this myself because I explored a little along the street that night alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/tfw20.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;sunset by the beach&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The dog might have already taken for granted this sunset&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bagacay-dumaguete&#34;&gt;Bagacay, Dumaguete&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing worth remembering here is the after-work, of course. The sooner I forget the dayshift, the better. I spent the night sharing good food with Isya&amp;rsquo;s mother, Merci, and her partner, Tito Jorge in a Chinese-filled Chinese bistro (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/Restaurant_Review-g616032-d18893995-Reviews-Halang_Halang_Restaurant-Dumaguete_City_Negros_Oriental_Negros_Island_Visayas.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halang Halang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it is called). This was also around the time when nCoV-19 was making its rounds offshore, still a whisper away. Before our orders even came, a power interruption made the night, uh, spicier, more than the food, even more so than the Chinese people who were relentlessly coughing and sneezing nearby. The brownout experience, though, was redeemed by their great food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interstitial&#34;&gt;INTERSTITIAL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/tfw13.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;bird&amp;#39;s eyeview of a mountain&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I think this is Mount Kanlaon?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In travels involving flights, I made it a point to at least give the scene below some looking. With my limited knowledge on local geography (yes to Pinoy Pride!), I can&amp;rsquo;t always figure out what place I am on top of. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that I&amp;rsquo;m no navigator, nor a traveller with a sense of direction. But I&amp;rsquo;m working on all of that. Meanwhile, that mountain ridge, though&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;laoag-ilocos-norte&#34;&gt;Laoag, Ilocos Norte&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/tfw10.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;building facade with a sign saying Ilocos Norte Capitol&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the efforts of people of Laoag to preserve and/or restore some of its old architecture, which supposedly is a blend of Spanish and Ilocano sensibilities. Whether this is by choice or by the fact that erecting new structures is costly, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the chance to know. I don&amp;rsquo;t speak Ilocano, unfortunately, despite my wanting to. I could mimic a fragment of their accent, but that&amp;rsquo;s about it. Thus, my interactions were limited to my Tagalog tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/tfw11.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;people gathering in front of the Capitol Building&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;People gathered in front of the Capitol for some event&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food is good. I brought home two kilograms of &lt;em&gt;bagnet&lt;/em&gt; (deep fried pork belly, Ilocan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;chicharon&lt;/em&gt;), which lasted us about a month. Natives of Ilocandia, if I may infer, are devotees of pork and vegetables. Who isn&amp;rsquo;t?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/tfw12.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;an intersection, a spire looms in the background&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;People going to the gathering in front of the Capitol for some event&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cabanatuan-nueva-ecija&#34;&gt;Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to a mall, everybody! One of the contractors offered lunch, and no one declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tarlac-city-tarlac&#34;&gt;Tarlac City, Tarlac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s both hot and humid in the afternoon &amp;ndash; typical weather in this region. Except it isn&amp;rsquo;t. These were the last few days of a fairly cool climate, and after that, everything would either melt or burn or wither in summer heat. Here in Tarlac, it would be flames, figuratively, I hope. But for now, enjoy the sun when it isn&amp;rsquo;t that warm yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lucena-city-quezon-province&#34;&gt;Lucena City, Quezon Province&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were received with plenty of plates of food before our inspection. Our timing couldn&amp;rsquo;t be better: the P-Team there were celebrating their 30th Anniversary of Something, which seemed important, hence the buffet. After the work, we were invited again to partake in another set of food. It rained that afternoon. Even without umbrella, no cold nor flu befell me as I dared dash through the drizzle. Also worth noting: someone from the P-Team offered to buy me a big tin can of broas. I tried to pay him back, but he kept pushing the bills back to my palms, shaking his head, smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bacolod-city&#34;&gt;Bacolod City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Bacolod the city of smiles? I think that&amp;rsquo;s the tagline of another city. Bacolod burns its rubbish wherever it&amp;rsquo;s convenient. Thrash-filled streets were no fun to walk on. What&amp;rsquo;s worse is the perennial smoke from all the burning thrash. Some of their food is okay, though. We tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/meisalmonhouse/&#34;&gt;Mei&amp;rsquo;s Salmon House&lt;/a&gt;, an eat-all-you-can salmon-everything food place. Their fish, they say, is imported from Canada!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ozamis-city&#34;&gt;Ozamis city&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first waft of air when I deplaned smelled like provincial cow shit, familiar and strong as always. I am reminded of much simpler times from way back&amp;hellip; It was a brief visit, as usual, because the rest of it was business-related, and you know I&amp;rsquo;d drop that in a heartbeat. Much of Misamis Occidental breezed past me on a window, in an unruly car ride to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dipolog-city&#34;&gt;Dipolog City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/tfw9.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;view of sidewalk by some local elementary school&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;1,837 kilometers from Rizal Park&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we settled. I chose &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.agoda.com/gv-hotel-dipolog-city/hotel/dipolog-ph.html&#34;&gt;GV Hotel&lt;/a&gt; not for its outstanding services, which they don&amp;rsquo;t have, nor for their polished facilities, which they also don&amp;rsquo;t have. In fact, if you click that link, Agoda will tell you it&amp;rsquo;s a one-star hotel. No, I chose GV Hotel because of its close proximity to our next business agenda in Zamboanga del Norte. Boulevard is also just several streets away. After lunch in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/Restaurant_Review-g659927-d8004943-Reviews-Grandma_s_Best-Dipolog_Zamboanga_del_Norte_Zamboanga_Peninsula_Mindanao.html&#34;&gt;Grandma&amp;rsquo;s Best&lt;/a&gt;, we went to Dakak Beach Resort in&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dapitan-city&#34;&gt;Dapitan City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/tfw8.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;view of a white-sand beach with a huge sign saying Dakak&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The only way to spend the afternoon: Beach!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/tfw7.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;view of a white-sand beach&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Well, not exactly. We were under the shade the whole 30 minutes we were here.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/tfw5.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;shade under a tree&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proof of said shade. Also, name this tree.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole leg was just a side trip, but a much needed one, if only to break away from work even for just a few hours. By the beach in &amp;lsquo;Jalosjos Country&amp;rsquo;, I got to see again the sea, my second time this year. Fine white sand met rubber soles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/tfw6.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;a cliff seen from the beach, surrounded by flora&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/tfw4.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;view of a mountainside by the beach?&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s still part of Jalosjos property&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we&amp;rsquo;re off to Rizal Shrine, about 10 kilometers away, a relatively short trip. The simple way of living of Pepe inspires me to do the same landscaping on our own residence in the future. We&amp;rsquo;ll see&amp;hellip; I only have a few pictures as souvenirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/tfw3.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;a painting depicting Rizal treating his mother&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Rizal&amp;rsquo;s raised octagonal clinic&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, we are still in lockdown. The distance that we must only travel has been drastically reduced. Perhaps out of boredom we will document our homebound travels, so local in scope it can only be done for free; and blog about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-O)-&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taiwan Trip, June 2019, (Part 2 of 2)</title>
      <link>/taiwan-part2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/taiwan-part2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you read &lt;a href=&#34;/taiwan-part1/&#34;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-3&#34;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ate breakfast in McDo, the one near the place we stayed in, and it didn’t serve any local variant of Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s food. It&amp;rsquo;s all hamburgers, fried chicken, and sausage McNothin’. Some would say that eating at a known (read: exploitive capitalist) fast food chain, one that you also have in your country, is a disservice to the self to get to know the locals or their food, but that wasn’t our case. This particular breakfast had us mingling with the locals. Saturday morning &amp;ndash; wolfing on a large breakfast meal; seeing kids being tutored at the other table; old couple eating their favorite grease-rich food after a walk; a father sharing a hearty meal with his son before a soccer game &amp;ndash; it was at a Mcdonald’s joint where we had the most telling glimpse of the locals in their element, and somehow, we belonged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twMC01.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;A view of Mcdonald&amp;#39;s from the MRT station&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Breakfast at Mcdo before the days adventure&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guesthouse we had stayed in is just two blocks from the MRT Station of the Brown Line. One of the destinations along this Brown Line are the Taipei Zoo and Maokong Gondola, the latter being the last station. We skipped the zoo because we don’t like looking down on animals in confined spaces. So the gondola it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maokong Gondola reveals an altitude we have never seen before. The mountain trees (not sure what they are) relax the tired eyes, although there still looms the urban side of Taipei, not far below, sharing the view. The dense forested area below gondolas’ route makes it bearable to think that on the unlikely chance that the cables snap, the trees would cushion our fall. Of course, no such thing happened. We were safe, and made it to Zhinan Temple Station, a Taoist Temple. Signs in golden calligraphy immediately caught our eyes as we entered the compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an inkling that Taiwanese people liked building temples. “What for?” we wondered. For maintaining their spirituality in spite of their trudge for Future? For tourists? Find the answer in its oriental architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the “spiritual” stint in Temple, we caught another gondola ride to the last station, the Maokong station. Naturally, it is where the tourists gravitate, being a haven for both tea cafes and restaurants. Hiking trails also proliferate the area, perfect for walking buffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twMG01.jpg&#34;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twMG12.jpg&#34;

            &lt;p&gt;Temple hopping no.2&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many things to do, so many places to see in this part of Maokong. Isya insisted on checking out the kettle holes and tea promotion building where we thought we could see an actual tea plantation. By then, it was way past lunchtime. All the walking we made up and down the winding roads, just to look for the best tea house had made us exhausted. Perhaps it was the combination of hunger and weariness that pushed us to continue searching for kettle holes and the tea promotion area. By the time we got to the latter, we could no longer ignore the grumbling of our stomachs. We headed straight to one of the tea restaurants, supposedly with high ratings, if we’re to believe the Google reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of what we’re already feeling, we’re still game for some adventure. On our way to the selected restaurant, we saw the sign to kettle holes. We debated whether it’s wise to tread down a steep slope, but empty stomachs gave us no wits for this misplaced adventurism, and we finally convinced ourselves to “make the most out of it.” Down the stairwell we went to the kettle holes. After hundreds of steps going down, several stream bends, and some towering ferns, one would hope that this better be worth it. Alas, the sight of the overrated kettle holes was anticlimactic. Though, better sight were the paths of ferns leading to other trails.  Also, a hanging bridge, guarded by stone cats and pandas on both ends, sway over the stream. These adorable statues delighted Isya, so much that she began cooing, as she is wont to do at the presence of such benevolence, cute or otherwise, flesh or stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way back, the flight of stairs became a million steps. &lt;em&gt;Tita&lt;/em&gt; Isya had to endure the ascent with cramps forming on her right leg, and a breath she’s running out of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended in a tea place called Yao Yue Tea House, a highly rated place in Wenshan. The place reminded us of Japanense aesthetics. We sat outside for an overlooking view of the hillside, near another couple who was already there. The oolong tea we ordered was served with a complete tea set, and was meant to be the traditional way. The menu came with a how-to-have-tea, so we made sure to follow them. We had chao fan, dumplings, and sweet and sour fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twTT01.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twTT02.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twTT03.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twTT04.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the late lunch, we decided to head out for Taipei 101, to get to know how monumental it really is up close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing that the street outside the tea house, is also a bus route that we could hop on to take us to the MRT. Waiting with the bus ride with us were two middle-aged people (a couple?). They asked us if a bus would pass by the tea place, to which we replied yes. The couple spoke Mandarin but are not from Taiwan. It was also their first time to visit. If we had to guess, they are either from Singapore, Malaysia or mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple was waiting for a different bus number. Some 20 minutes had passed, a bus began approaching, going down the direction of the mountain. Isya thought that this might be the bus to hop onto, so she flagged it down. When the door swung open, the driver didn’t exactly let us in. There was irritation in the way he spoke, but we didn’t understand any of it. We got the hint that this wasn’t the bus. Ohio felt embarrassed in this short affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another 10 minutes, another bus passed by on the way to Maokong Gondola station. Knowing it was not our bus, we didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to flag it down. But the couple who were with us did. However, the driver didn’t let them in yet, as he had to finish the trip, which only meant going to the end point, the Maokong Gondola station, before returning. Not to worry, though, the couple said when they reported back to us, that that exact bus should be back in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we all got to talking, not minding the obvious language barrier. People will always find ways to connect with one another, looking for something to share with. In this case, a bus took the shape of the common denominator. When the bus returned, the couple were kind enough to offer to ask the driver if it would pass by any MRT station along its route. “Any MRT would do,” we told the couple, and from there, we could again navigate Taipei by ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driver essentially said yes. We all boarded the bus. Drum rolls halt; curtains fall. Looking back on it, it’s nice to know there are still good-hearted people, some of them are even willing to bridge the babel between strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twT101.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-4&#34;&gt;Day 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reportage-on-isyas-30th-birthday&#34;&gt;Reportage on Isya&amp;rsquo;s 30th birthday:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning was supposed to be celebrated on Yehliu Geopark, but we got out of bed late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had we really intended to rise early, what would have we done there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditation, perhaps, by the boulders, attempting to learn the chemistry of earth and sea if only we understood their clashing methods. In order to study rocks, one must be wary of navigating their interface, first by sight, then by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biking is also one form of getting around the Geopark, we heard. It would have been another form of meditation, too, with the added benefit of aerobics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, we got out of bed late, like we said. Time is relative, Einstein notioned, and in the cozy abode in which we lost sleep, time were the hours spent motionless, in rest instead of in preparation. In our daily reflection, we gave up on the idea of traveling for two hours just to see some weird rock formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we settled for a nearby venue: Huashan Creative Park. The Park showcased talents from different artists. Lots of pretty hand-made items we could have bought as souvenirs, if only one of us weren’t so strict with budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the buildings in the Park, we ate lunch at Alleycat&amp;rsquo;s, a pizzeria that already offers alcoholic drinks as early as noon. Our bill spiked to NTD 1,056 for the pizza and several little dishes we ordered. Not good, or charge to experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twCP03.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twCP01.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twCP02.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several MRT stations away, we found loitering in the greenery of Da’an Forest Park. Here we increased our steps while taking in the view, watching people what they do in forest parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parks are meant to be inclusive, as Da’an Forest Park is. Plenty of seats are provided for old people when they get tired. Some ambulatory aisles have been fitted with handrails for people on rehabilitation, when they are still regaining the power of their legs. Ramps make it accessible for wheelchairs, trolleys, and other wheeled contraptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An orchestra was performing on an open auditorium in Da&amp;rsquo;an Forest Park. The acoustics of the place, surprisingly, makes it easy for visitors to hear all the different notes of all the different instruments playing. We stuck around for awhile, until they finished their rendition of a Michael Jackson mixtape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last stop for the day before retiring to bed was Shilin Night Market. Here’s a short list of our purchases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fried dumplings worth NTD 50; tasty and plentiful, a good food intro before diving into the heart of the night market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grilled octopus tentacle worth NTD 140; expensive for its bland taste, don’t eat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stinky tofu worth NTD 80; while okay on its own, it could have been better if we ate it with a small bowl of rice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milk tea holder worth NTD 100; a gift to bring back home, but also serves as a template for Isya for her to make thousands more of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sticker worth NTD 30; pink, with the image of two fists bumping headlined by the words &amp;ldquo;real friends&amp;rdquo; all in capital letters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twSH01.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twSH02.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twSH03.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twSH04.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-5&#34;&gt;Day 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late lunch at Tamed Fox. &lt;em&gt;Late&lt;/em&gt; being the operative word here, and probably a favorite of ours, given our tendency to stay up late and wake up late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny thing: we went to this Tamed Fox restaurant in search of a carrot cake. A craving for carrot cake had stirred Isya for her birthday, but when faced with the fact that there’s a shortage of it in Taipei, she was all the more determined to look for one. Ohio, on the other hand, looked up for restaurants, pastry shops, and bakeries that serve the best carrot cakes. On our research, we found instead doughnut that’s supposed to taste like carrot cake, in this artsy/healthy restaurant named Tamed Fox. We were excited to try them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, when it’s time to order asked for their doughnut, the server told us that it has been a long time since they last sold those doughnuts. You see, it has been removed from their menu. Powerless then Isya became, and her heart, now a million pieces all over, could only be mended by settling for a matcha coconut milk drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After realizing we just had an expensive lunch &amp;ndash; the healthy options on the menu could simply be their marketing tool to jack the price up &amp;ndash; we made got our hands wet when we made our own paper at Suho Paper Museum. It’s a memorial built to honor its founder. It’s also Suho’s (the founder, duh) response to Taiwan’s lacking of paper museum at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roof deck provided a wonderful view of the busy district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twSP01.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twSP02.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twSP03.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way to Eslite Bookshop, we witnessed a car accident, known in Filipino slang as &amp;lsquo;carambola&amp;rsquo;. This particular one involved four vehicles on a single lane bumping into each other because the one on the front may have floored the brake too hard, so that it ensues further miscalculations for the drivers behind him. These kinds of accidents still happen in a city more disciplined than Manila. Isya inferred, &amp;ldquo;As long as there are cars, and there are humans driving them, there will always be car accidents.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eslite bookshop is a wonderful tourist destination, it is a five story bookstore that operates 24/7. Its presence in the heart of the city just goes to show that Taiwanese hold high regard to reading. The promise of knowledge contained in books is always enticing to come and open its pages, especially if the cover captures my attention. We were told not to judge them by appearance alone, but the books in Eslite Bookshop hold many promises, if only we could read the characters. Definitely, we would like to spend more time if only we were not confined to reading only English alphabet letters. It doesn’t only house books but is also a place to showcase arts and crafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-6&#34;&gt;Day 6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last day on the busy Taipei. We got up late, went outside by noon to have lunch for the second time on a nearby eatery. Most of the viands are vegetables, all of which I find palatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second only to Fuyang Eco Park, I find Dahu Park, one of my favorite places we went to. The lack of people (at the time, at least) definitely made it more attractive. Plus, the building on the entrance has an indoor swimming pool. Will we ever get to practice our breast strokes there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twGP01.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/twGP02.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also built a memorial hall for Sun Yat Sen, another of Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s founding fathers, though not as grand as Chiang Kai-Shek&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last major stop was the Songshan Cultural Park. It was where we ate dinner, and tried my first (and last) cold brew coffee WITH lemonade. I bought my first (and, due to the price, possibly last) Leuchtturm1917 there, with a Bauhaus theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We witnessed a scooter catching fire. Two fire trucks were quick to respond to the scene, and in no time, they put out the fire. Not many tourists could go back home and have that story with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-7&#34;&gt;Day 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to Manila, where else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hotter is its afternoon than Taipei. Hotter still is its smog, but in its familiarity we reveled instead our memories of the alien land which we had to leave. Our lives are here, in Manila, for now; and in its strange new buildings, we tried looking for tiled facades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;closing-notes-epilogue&#34;&gt;Closing Notes, Epilogue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isya has been stressing about bed bug bites she had the whole trip, which might be an allergic reaction. It was super itchy and warm that it woke her up in the middle of the night to scratch the bites. Yes, it was a big not to scratch inflamed bites but the itch was agonizing and torturous. What is more stressing is the fact that we couldn’t figure out where she got the bites because Ohio never got any. So, the source might not be in our bedroom, let alone on the bed. And it’s entirely improbable it’s in something we ate, because we practically ate the same food. The only possible source would be during our hike at the Fuyang Eco park on our very first day at Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Day 3, we did get to the Tower. If you’re the type of person who never liked being surrounded by many people, consider this: Taipei 101 might seem overrated, but seeing it in person cannot be, uh, &lt;em&gt;overlooked&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Day 5, we had &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; lunch &amp;ndash; ramen &amp;ndash; after our visit in Suho Paper Museum. At the unholy afternoon hour, no one else was in the diner, and we wondered whether we were early for dinner.
Lastly, here are interesting pics of clean Taiwan streets. Go find them. &lt;code&gt;-o)-&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

      <title>Taiwan Trip, June 2019, (Part 1 of 2)</title>
      <link>/taiwan-part1/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;5w-1h-of-it&#34;&gt;5W, 1H of it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last week of October 2018, Gab (Isya’s sister) and Merci (Isya’s mother) went to Taipei, Taiwan to attend Gab’s first international group exhibit. Aside from that, they took the trip as a break from their usual routines in Manila and Dumaguete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their five-day stay in Taipei, Taiwan did not bring any actual “pasalubong” or take-home gifts, but they had a lot of stories and memorable experiences to share with us, me and Ohio. We were enamored by their first hand experience and intrigued by their descriptions of what Taipei is for them. Gab describes it as a mini-chill Japan, and a city filled with trees. It had such a huge impact on her that made her want to study Mandarin. That gave us the impression that Taiwan is worth visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing that for Filipinos wanting to experience Taiwan, it is not difficult since we are granted visa-free entry until the end of July 2019. (Update: As of writing, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3721553&#34;&gt;visa-free entry has been extended until 2020&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohio had just gotten his first ever Philippine Passport that he intends to use for his (limited) travel tendencies. Now, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t blame others if they hadn&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to use theirs outside of a legal documentation of their existence. Perhaps their circumstances prevent them the luxury of traveling abroad, and whatnot. He hopes not to ever get stuck in one place, is what he had always wished for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it started with an idea from a different field of interest. Ohio was watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://invidio.us/watch?v=gNtxiZJ-jQE&#34;&gt;a video of The Verge&lt;/a&gt; regarding the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18125461/must-have-apps-hopper-halide-splitwise-dark-sky-google-photos&#34;&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt; they love to recommend, and the first app that they mentioned was Hopper. It lets you find and track low-price flights and hotels. He downloaded it and gave it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopper&amp;rsquo;s landing page greeted the user with two blank spaces in which to put a starting point (Manila, no less!) and destination. In the many endpoints on the globe&amp;rsquo;s surface, we limited our considerations to budget and distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was January; Year 2019, and Ohio’s mind wandered, and always has been prone to going off tangent. The significant portion his childhood consists of meshing daydreams with studies of reality&amp;hellip; Anyway, Ohio’s thought of visiting Hanoi; or Bangkok wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so bad as a first international flight for him; or would the traffic conditions in Jakarta be as bad as he hear they say it to be? He thought all of this, and other Southeast Asian countries and typed their capitals in the Hopper, checking for prices and availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ohio consulted Isya for her opinion, her response was immediate, as sure as she always is. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s go to Taiwan!&amp;rdquo; she said. At the time of planning, Taiwan had granted Visa-free entry for Philippine passport holders up to July 2019. We wanted to hop on this opportunity which only made sense to choose to travel to Taiwan. Everything clicked all right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried looking for the cheapest flight to Taipei, Taiwan and chanced upon Cebu Pacific, with the help of Hopper. The two-way ticket for the both us, cost around Php 15,000. It was the basic fare offered with no check-in luggage and no meals. We also decided to forego add-ons like preferred seat and insurance. It was Ohio’s idea that we purchase travel insurance from other insurance company named &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chubbtravelinsurance.com.ph/&#34;&gt;Chubb&lt;/a&gt; that has a more comprehensive benefit, in case something unfortunate happened to us abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With enough savings in our pockets, we booked a trip to Taiwan. We were giddy about the whole trip because it was our first trip together abroad and it was Ohio’s first international trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also worth mentioning that the biggest factor, after all, that drove the idea to travel this year 2019, was to celebrate Isya&amp;rsquo;s 30th birthday in some other country. An important enough of a milestone deserves a memorable itinerary, which we will share in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;processing-the-preparation&#34;&gt;Processing the Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was January 2019. Your mornings and nights might have been different from one another, yet when we refer back to our mental notes, nothing out of the blue rocked any of us. The same unimportant people were seated on important seats. The struggle had to beat on to remind us of the singular goal we all should move to. But we were plotting an escape, a temporary one, Isya and I, to remind us that there are other places, too, where we could move to, and possibly learn from. She had just booked a flight for the two of us to Taiwan, scheduled on her birth week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advertisement&#34;&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This segment is brought to you by the nugget of wisdom of one Anita Desai. She said, &amp;ldquo;Wherever you go becomes a part of you somehow.&amp;rdquo; In immersing ourselves, albeit for only a week, in the atmosphere of Taipei, Taiwan, we hope that we had grasped something from its people and culture to take and share back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we decided on the date and purchased the ticket, the next practical thing to do would be to find a place to stay. We asked for recommendations, from relatives to friends to what would be the best option. It seemed that AirBnB was the obvious choice. It was not an easy process to find a place that we both would agree to. We considered things including budget, proximity to both bus and MRT stations. Also, is it a crowded area? Is it noisy in the neighborhood? Does it have a shared bathroom? Would we be alone in the place, or if not, would we have at least our own room? For every place I found that I thought would fit our wants and needs, I consulted Ohio to get his opinion and yes to the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first AirBnB house we said yes to isn’t in the usual touristy area, nor does environment looked busy. It was on a hill, and we had the entire place for ourselves – our own kitchen, bathroom, and even lavatory. The AirBnB was in Da’an District. We were excited and made our itinerary based on the place we booked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked our flight 6 months before the actual travel, that’s why we never bothered and worried that much of our confirmed reservation. Alas, come May our host cancelled our reservation due to a personal emergency. This disappointed us in that we would never get to experience the place. Plus, we had to look for another place in such a short time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second time we had to look for a place proved to be a harder task, and options were limited, many of which cost higher and in locations that we initially disliked. We tried hard to find a place in the same district as the first one. It was Ohio, who was able to chance upon this bedroom-only, shared bath, and within our budget also located in Da’an. The catch was the minimum stay is 7 nights; we were there for only 6 nights total. We tried looking at the other options but ultimately opted for what Ohio found, because it was cheaper than the rest, and found at decent-looking location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only got serious in doing our itinerary, days before our set travel date. So, how does one exactly make a memorable itinerary? We don&amp;rsquo;t know. That&amp;rsquo;s why during the waiting period, we asked our friends and family for suggestions. We also watched travel vlogs, read other seminal wanderers&#39; travel diaries, and even did our own due diligence, dude. But to have a proper itinerary from the culmination of information these multiple sources provided, we had to narrow them down, applying whatever constraints we set up ourselves in. We, creatives that we think we are, thought it would be more sanguine if we came up with our own versions, to be fact-checked together when we&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/tw-itinerary.png&#34;
         alt=&#34;Itinerary in excel sheet&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;How our itinerary looked like&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central idea behind the making of both versions of itinerary relied on the location of the booked AirBnB. This meant that the first few locations that we&amp;rsquo;d like to explore must be within walking distance, then venturing outwards the Da&amp;rsquo;an District, further as the week progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The itinerary was a mish-mash of recommendations from relatives and friends plus from our own research. We definitely work hard for wonder filled itinerary. Ohio and I had our task of creating a 7-day itinerary that we would both enjoy. We had written on Google sheet with the details of places, how to get there, coordinates, where to eat. For my part, I was so much into details that Ohio warned me that the itinerary should not be rigid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;final&lt;/em&gt; draft of our Taipei Itinerary was completed only days before the actual trip. And by &amp;lsquo;completed&amp;rsquo;, I meant we had only planned for the first three days. We agreed that we would finish the schedule on Taipei itself. A fun way to procrastinate, sure, but there were no real crippling deadlines, so we allowed ourselves this. Alas, once we got there, we ditched the itinerary. Looking back on it now, its demise liberated us with Lao Tzu&amp;rsquo;s timeless wit: &amp;ldquo;A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent on arriving.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day before our trip, Isya decided to buy extra luggage because we each had 7 kg of carry-on. As most of you know, Isya thinks she has a &lt;em&gt;tita&lt;/em&gt; body syndrome: which means not carrying heavy bags at her “age.” She purchased a 20 kgs additional weight and we were able to bring a small luggage with wheel (ah, the convenience). The additional luggage costs us an additional expense of PhP 2,000.00 &amp;ndash; for Isya, it was worth the extra spending for comfort and evade backache. It would have cost much more if one of us got back injured.  😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;actual-travel-and-impressions&#34;&gt;Actual Travel and Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set out early on the breaking dawn of 13th of January. We thought that we might be able to take the P2P (point-to-point) bus, but our flight was too early for the first bus scheduled to depart Quezon City. We had no choice but to take the convenient (but overpriced) Grab.  Although our flight was at 7:20 am, we allotted three hours of travel time,  considering the hellscape of Manila traffic. We were wrong, though, as traffic at those wee hours in the morning were relatively light and not a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Overcast weather by the airport runway.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming from Manila&amp;rsquo;s daily traffic congestion, the efficiency of Taipei&amp;rsquo;s transportation system is a welcoming shock. Pedestrians need not to race against time when crossing streets, as most motorists know to obey traffic rules. While there are still rude drivers, they are a minority, at least from what we have observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuyang lane in Da&amp;rsquo;an District, where we booked our stay for one week, seemed an ideal neighborhood: few people, few motorists, serene. Not to mention there is an Eco Park well within strolling distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a great afternoon walk after checking in at our AirBnB. It was a mini exploration of the neighborhood. One of the nearest “touristy” place in the neighborhood is the Fuyang Eco Park which, arguably,  cannot be explored in one day. Still, the willing ear could almost hear the clatter of species in such green space, if it&amp;rsquo;s patient to distill the wind for their sounds. Otherwise, the slopes, the signs, even the trees sometimes, lead the way. The legs only have to follow the path of least resistance, but such cannot always be the case. It&amp;rsquo;s a good kind of fatigue, in our opinion, to be in the humbling presence of sentinel trees. When we visit again, we will try going to the cicadas’ area to hear their daily hymn.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The park also offered a view of the famous Taipei 101. It was a rainy and cloudy on our first day in Taiwan that a glimpse of the towering structure left us in awe. The experience at the park in a city has offered us what we can only hope or wish for Manila – the balance between greens (nature) and concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our continued exploration of the neighborhood made us wander to the nearest convenience store just a block away from our AirBnB. Interesting that it’s the same 7/11 we have in the Philippines, but with more and better selection of milk tea and coffee. We can say at this point that Isya is addicted to milk tea while Ohio on the other hand has gusto for drinking coffee. We did not spare any second in trying out local milk tea and coffee products found at the convenience store.  Other perks of having to drink these delicious beverages also include Ohio’s observation that many of the receipts (that had accumulated during the trip) have dimensions thatplay around 50mm x 75mm (2&amp;quot; x 3&amp;quot;). Little info is printed on the paper, except for the amount you paid for the goods/services, and some QR codes that you can scan for more details. This tactic is definitely a nod to needing less paper and ink, but going digital doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean going green. Moreover, Isya also observed that these receipts serve as raffle tickets to what game, we don’t know. We wish we knew how to read some of the characters on the receipt that might have given us a clue on how to join and what the prizes are.  😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;/images/tw20.jpeg&#34;
         alt=&#34;receipts laid out randomly on a table&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Receipts&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We capped of our day with beef noodles and sayote tops cooked in sesame oil. It wasn’t an easy feat getting that tasty beef noodles because we got lost in all the foreign characters written on the order sheet. We were reluctant to speak lest we miscommunicate our intentions. If there were a competition for shy couples in a trip abroad, we think we would take the grand prize for The Shyest Pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-2&#34;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our second day, we ditched our itinerary and decided to go where it’s convenient with the light rain and overcast weather. We went out to immerse ourselves in the grandiose of Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall.  The landmark houses the National Theater, National Concert Hall, and the main building that houses the huge monument of Chang Kai-Shek.  A spectacle we witnessed was the changing of honor guards.  Isya felt like the guards themselves were in deep meditation, as their synchronised movements require complete concentration and precision. Likewise, the choreography amazed Ohio, but he zoned out in the middle of the routine.  We wondered, “Does Chiang Kai-Shek even appreciate the hourly show of changing guards?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digesting Chang Kai-Shek’s life and works made us hungry that after the slow tour we did by ourselves, we headed out in search for a place to eat. In its large complex area, we discovered a forested area at the back of the Memorial Hall, replete with different types of pine trees. More interestingly, tiny, nimble creatures live in the tiny forest – squirrels. They populate the area and are not afraid to get close to visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our search for a place to eat continued. After walking a few wide blocks away from the complex. There were a lot of café and pastry shop, but we wanted a heavy meal to fuel us for the rest of the day. We had our fill at this Japanese fast food restaurant, Sukiya, that specializes in curry dishes.  After filling, and having a breather from all the walking, we strode again and went to explore efficient metro rail transit.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another landmark worth visiting is the Red House found at the heart of one of Taipei’s shopping districts. Despite what its namesake implies, it has nothing to do with prostitution. It’s just literally red because of the bricks used for its structure. The Red House provides a market for local creatives where they can sell their arts and crafts. Inquisitive that Isya is, all the arts and crafts that she saw evoked feelings &amp;ndash; feelings best explained by her exaltation &lt;em&gt;oohs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ahhs&lt;/em&gt;. Ohio, on the other hand, would comment how it would be “an unnecessary purchase.” We didn&amp;rsquo;t buy anything, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good, sometimes, to have a flexible itinerary, to give time to breathe, to give ourselves the chance to change the direction of steps, to explore the districts with or without access to internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taipei boasts of extensive night markets scattered around the city, where you can eat different foods and buy stuff you might or might not need. The first night market we went to was the Ningxia Night Market, and it can host a train of people. One may want to quicken their pace, unless they find the smell of stinky tofu pleasant. We dipped our hands on grilled large mushrooms, watermelon juice, and red bean with custard pastry. This is one of the lowkey night markets in Taipei, yet is frequented by locals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole trip we made whopping 23k steps. Fatigue finally kicked us in once we got back to the guesthouse and saw our bed. &lt;code&gt;-o)-&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continue to &lt;a href=&#34;/taiwan-part2/&#34;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
