We like to read.

But we're not one of those voracious readers who can't seem to get enough of books, and we envy them sometimes.

And yet, the number of books that we have continue to accumulate, only collecting dust in the corner where we pushed them.

If you love reading books, why not visit our second-hand bookstore on Instagram? 
We try to update the selection. 
Proceeds will directly benefit the owners, Pablo and Edgar (dog and cat, respectively).
